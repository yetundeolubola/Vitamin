    <string name="about_vitamin">Vitamins are organic compounds that are needed in small quantities to
        sustain life. Most vitamins need to come from food. This is because the human body either does
        not produce enough of them, or it does not produce any at all. A vitamin is one of a group of
        organic substances that is present in minute amounts in natural foodstuffs. Vitamins are essential
        to normal metabolism. If we do not take enough of any kind of vitamin, certain medical conditions can result.
        There are currently 13 recognized vitamins. Vitamin A,Vitamin B,Vitamin B2,Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5,Vitamin B6,
        Vitamin B7,Vitamin B9,Vitamin B12,Vitamin C,Vitamin D,Vitamin E,Vitamin K Vitamins are either water-soluble or
        fat-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins are easier for the body to store than water-soluble. Vitamins always contain carbon,
